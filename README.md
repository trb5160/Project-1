# Project-1

## Notes

line 30 in the app.js file you will find the varible userDestination storing the users selected destination that they input into the search box. I stored this information so we can use it in the other areas of the project.

You will also see in line 31 of the app.js file that I console.log the value of userDestination to ensure that it is working correctly.
